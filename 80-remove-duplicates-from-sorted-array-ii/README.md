To solve Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II (Leetcode 80) using the two-pointer approach, we can optimize as follows:

Two Pointer Technique:
- We use two pointers, i and j:
- i iterates through each element in the array.
- j tracks the position where the next valid element (up to two occurrences) should be placed.

Limiting Duplicate Count:
- For each element at index i, we check if it can be included by comparing it to the element at j - 2:
  - If nums[i] != nums[j - 2], we can place nums[i] at index j, as this ensures at most two occurrences of each unique element.
  - If nums[i] == nums[j - 2], the element is a third occurrence (or more), so itâ€™s skipped.
- This efficiently maintains up to two instances of each unique number in the list without extra storage.

Result and Valid Count:
- Once the iteration is complete, j will represent the length of the modified array with valid elements, as all excess duplicates have been filtered out in place.
